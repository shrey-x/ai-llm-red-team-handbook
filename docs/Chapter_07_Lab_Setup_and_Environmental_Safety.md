# Chapter 7: Lab Setup and Environmental Safety

## 7.1 Why Lab Setup and Environmental Safety Matter

A properly designed test environment (or "lab") is crucial in AI red teaming to:

- Prevent accidental impact on production systems or real users.
- Ensure security and privacy of test data and credentials.
- Allow realistic simulation of adversarial actions.
- Enable efficient logging, evidence capture, and troubleshooting.

AI/LLM red teaming often deals with powerful models, sensitive data, and complex cloud/software stacks - amplifying the need for rigorous safety throughout engagement.

## 7.2 Key Properties of a Secure Red Team Lab

- **Isolation:** The lab should be separated from production networks, data, and users. Use separate credentials, access tokens, and compute resources.
- **Replicability:** The lab setup should be reproducible. Document networking, configs, plugin versions, and data snapshots.
- **Controlled Data:** Use synthetic or anonymized data whenever possible; never expose real customer data unless absolutely required and authorized.
- **Monitoring:** Enable comprehensive logging (system, model, plugin, and network) for easy tracking of all red team actions and system responses.
- **Access Control:** Restrict lab access to authorized red teamers and client observers. Employ temporary or revocable credentials.

## 7.3 Lab Setup Tasks

1. **Provision Isolated Environments**
   - Dedicated VMs, containers, or cloud environments (e.g., staging, sandbox, test).
   - No connectivity to production unless specifically needed and approved.
2. **Deploy Target Systems**
   - LLMs, plugins, APIs, and other components in scope installed and configured to match production as closely as practical.
   - Populate with safe test data or limited synthetic sensitive data if needed.
3. **Configure Access Controls**
   - Create test accounts, temporary tokens, restricted network/firewall rules.
   - Audit permissions - least privilege should be enforced everywhere.
4. **Install Monitoring and Logging**
   - Ensure all red team actions and system events are captured.
   - Use SIEM/log aggregation solutions or simple file-based logs as appropriate.
5. **Evidence and Artifact Handling**
   - Set up secure storage for logs, screenshots, code artifacts, and red team “tools.”
   - Plan evidence handoff protocol for later reporting and remediation.

## 7.4 Safety Precautions for LLM Testing

- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent accidental denial-of-service or brute-force flooding of systems.
- **Kill Switches:** Maintain mechanisms to pause or halt the environment instantly in case of runaway tests or unintentional impacts.
- **Credential Safety:** Never reuse production credentials. Treat any credential, API key, or secret as sensitive - even in test.
- **Data Containment:** Prevent test data (especially adversarial prompts or outputs) from leaking outside the controlled lab.

## 7.5 Example Lab Topologies

### Simple Topology

Red Team VM(s) ---> Test LLM/API Env ---> Staging Plugins/DBs ---> Synthetic Data Sources

### Segmented Topology (for large engagements)

Red Team Zone
|
|---> Isolated LLM+Plugins Lab (matches client prod as close as possible)
|
|---> Logging/Evidence Server (read-only access for client POCs)

## 7.6 Checklist: Is Your Lab Ready?

- [ ] All in-scope systems deployed and functional in isolated environment.
- [ ] Logs, monitoring, and evidence capture methods tested.
- [ ] Access/control boundaries reviewed and verified with client.
- [ ] Test data scrubbed or synthetic.
- [ ] Direct connectivity to production confirmed as out-of-scope or properly firewalled.
- [ ] Emergency pause procedure documented and tested.

## 7.7 Environmental Safety: Ethics and Practicality

Remember:

- Any error in lab setup can lead to privacy violations, regulatory breaches, or business impact.
- Pre-engagement "fire drills" (e.g., test your kill switch, credential revocation, and isolation) are vital for real-world readiness.
- Communicate environment changes or unexpected lab events promptly to the client.
