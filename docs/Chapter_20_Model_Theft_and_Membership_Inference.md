# Chapter 20: Model Theft and Membership Inference

_This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of model extraction attacks, membership inference techniques, privacy violations in ML systems, intellectual property theft, watermarking, detection methods, and defense strategies for protecting model confidentiality._

## Introduction

Model theft and membership inference attacks represent critical threats to the confidentiality and privacy of machine learning systems. While traditional cybersecurity focuses on protecting data at rest and in transit, ML systems introduce new attack surfaces where the model itself becomes a valuable target for theft, and queries to the model can leak sensitive information about training data.

**Why Model Theft Matters:**

- **Intellectual Property Loss**: Models represent millions in R&D investment
- **Competitive Advantage**: Stolen models enable competitors to replicate capabilities without investment
- **Privacy Violations**: Membership inference can reveal who was in training data
- **Revenue Loss**: Attackers bypass paid API services with stolen models
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA require protecting training data privacy

**Real-World Impact:**

- OpenAI's GPT models cost millions to train; theft eliminates this barrier
- Healthcare ML models trained on patient data; membership inference violates HIPAA
- Financial models predicting creditworthiness; theft enables unfair competition
- Recommendation systems; extraction reveals business intelligence

**Chapter Scope:**

This chapter covers 16 major areas including query-based extraction, active learning attacks, LLM-specific theft, membership inference, model inversion, attribute inference, watermarking, detection, defenses, privacy-preserving ML, case studies, and legal compliance.

## 20.1 Model Extraction Attacks

**What is Model Extraction:**

Model extraction (model stealing) is an attack where an adversary queries a victim model to create a functionally equivalent copy. The attacker treats the victim model as a black box, sending inputs and observing outputs to train their own substitute model.

**Why This Matters:**

- Intellectual property theft (stealing expensive trained models)
- Enables subsequent attacks (adversarial examples, membership inference)
- Bypasses API access controls and pricing
- Competitive advantage through stolen capabilities

### 20.1.1 Query-Based Model Extraction

**How It Works:**

1. **Query Generation**: Create diverse inputs
2. **Label Collection**: Get predictions from victim model
3. **Substitute Training**: Train your own model on (query, prediction) pairs
4. **Validation**: Test substitute model accuracy vs. victim

**Practical Example - Steal a Sentiment Classifier:**

```

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Query Budget**: 100-1000 queries often sufficient for simple models
2. **Agreement Rate**: >80% agreement = successful theft
3. **Detection Evasion**: Use rate limiting and diverse queries
4. **Real-World**: Replace simulated victim with actual API endpoint?

**Definition:**

Model extraction (or model stealing) is the process of replicating the functionality of a target ML model through API queries, without direct access to the model's parameters, architecture, or training data.

```text
Model Extraction Attack Flow:

Attacker
  │ Sends queries
  v
Target Model (Black Box - API only)
  │ Returns predictions
  v
Query-Response Pairs Collected
  │ Train on pairs
  v
Surrogate Model (Stolen Copy)
```

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Query-Only Access**: Attacker only needs API access, not internal access
- **Black-Box Attack**: No knowledge of model architecture or weights required
- **Functional Replication**: Goal is to mimic behavior, not exact parameter recovery
- **Automated & Scalable**: Can be fully automated with scripts
- **Cost-Effective**: Cheaper than training from scratch

## 20.2 Membership Inference Attacks

**What is Membership Inference:**

Membership inference determines whether a specific data sample was part of a model's training dataset. This is a serious privacy violation, especially for models trained on sensitive data (medical records, financial data, personal information).

**Why This Matters:**

- **Privacy Violation**: Reveals who/what was in training data
- **GDPR/HIPAA Compliance**: Illegal disclosure of personal data
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Reveals business secrets (customer lists)
- **Discrimination Risk**: Exposes protected attributes

### 20.2.1 Practical Membership Inference Attack

**How It Works:**

1. **Train Shadow Models**: Create models similar to target using public data
2. **Build Attack Dataset**: Label shadow model's training/test samples
3. **Train Attack Model**: Meta-classifier learns membership signals
4. **Attack Target**: Use attack model to infer membership in target

```

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Attack Success**: >65% accuracy indicates privacy leak
2. **AUC Metric**: >0.7 means model memorizes training data
3. **Shadow Models**: 3-5 shadows usually sufficient
4. **Real-World**: Replace synthetic data with actual public dataset

**Defense Recommendations:**

- Use differential privacy (DP-SGD)
- Add prediction noise
- Regularization + early stopping
- Limit API query rate

## 20.16 Summary and Key Takeaways

### Critical Attack Techniques

**Most Effective Model Theft Methods:**

1. **Active Learning Extraction** (90-95% fidelity achievable)

   - Uncertainty sampling minimizes queries
   - Boundary exploration maximizes information gain
   - Can replicate model with 10x fewer queries than random sampling
   - Industry example: Stealing GPT-3 capabilities with 50K queries vs 500K random

2. **LLM Knowledge Distillation** (85-90% capability transfer)

   - Prompt-based extraction very effective
   - Task-specific theft cost-efficient
   - Fine-tuning on API responses creates competitive model
   - Example: $100K in API calls vs $5M training cost

3. **Membership Inference with Shadow Models** (80-90% AUC)
   - Train multiple shadow models
   - Meta-classifier achieves high accuracy
   - Works even with limited queries
   - Privacy risk: GDPR violations, lawsuits

**Most Dangerous Privacy Attacks:**

1. **Membership Inference** - Reveals who was in training data
2. **Model Inversion** - Reconstructs training samples
3. **Attribute Inference** - Infers sensitive properties

### Defense Recommendations

**For API Providers (Model Owners):**

1. **Access Control & Monitoring**

   - Strong authentication and API keys
   - Rate limiting (e.g., 1000 queries/hour/user)
   - Query pattern analysis to detect extraction
   - Behavioral anomaly detection
   - Honeypot queries to catch thieves

2. **Output Protection**

   - Add noise to predictions (ε=0.01)
   - Round probabilities to 2 decimals
   - Return only top-k classes
   - Confidence masking (hide exact probabilities)
   - Prediction poisoning (5% wrong answers)

3. **Model Protection**
   - Watermark models with backdoors
   - Fingerprint with unique behaviors
   - Regular audits for stolen copies
   - Legal terms of service

**For Privacy (Training Data Protection):**

1. **Differential Privacy Training**

   - Use DP-SGD with ε<10, δ<10^-5
   - Adds noise to gradients during training
   - Formal privacy guarantees
   - Prevents membership inference

2. **Regularization & Early Stopping**

   - Strong L2 regularization
   - Dropout layers
   - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
   - Reduces memorization of training data

3. **Knowledge Distillation**
   - Train student model on teacher predictions
   - Student never sees raw training data
   - Removes memorization artifacts

**For Organizations:**

1. **Due Diligence**

   - Vet third-party models and APIs
   - Check for watermarks/fingerprints
   - Verify model provenance
   - Regular security audits

2. **Compliance**

   - GDPR Article 17 (right to erasure)
   - HIPAA privacy rules
   - Document data usage
   - Implement deletion procedures

3. **Incident Response**
   - Plan for model theft scenarios
   - Legal recourse preparation
   - PR crisis management
   - Technical countermeasures

### Future Trends

**Emerging Threats:**

- **Automated Extraction Tools**: One-click model theft
- **Cross-Modal Attacks**: Steal image model via text queries
- **Federated Learning Attacks**: Extract from distributed training
- **Side-Channel Extraction**: Power analysis, timing attacks
- **AI-Assisted Theft**: Use AI to optimize extraction queries

**Defense Evolution:**

- **Certified Defenses**: Provable security guarantees
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify without revealing model
- **Blockchain Provenance**: Immutable model ownership records
- **Federated Learning Privacy**: Secure multi-party computation
- **Hardware Protection**: TEEs, secure enclaves

### Key Statistics from Research

- **68%** of ML APIs vulnerable to basic extraction (2020 study)
- **>80%** membership inference accuracy on unprotected models
- **10-100x** ROI for model theft vs training from scratch
- **€20M** maximum GDPR fine for privacy violations
- **90%** fidelity achievable with <1% of training data as queries

### Critical Takeaways

1. **Model Theft is Easy**: API access + scripts = stolen model
2. **Privacy Leaks are Real**: Membership inference works on most models
3. **Defenses Exist**: DP training, rate limiting, watermarking
4. **Cost vs Benefit**: Defending is cheaper than being stolen from
5. **Legal Matters**: Terms of service, watermarks provide recourse
6. **Compliance is Critical**: GDPR/HIPAA violations have huge penalties
