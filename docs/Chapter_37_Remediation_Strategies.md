## 37.1 The Importance of Presentation

Delivering findings is more than handing over a report - it's about ensuring your audience understands the issues, accepts their significance, and is empowered to act on them. Successful presentation:

- Fosters collaboration between red teamers, defenders, and executives.
- Reduces the risk of misinterpretation or dismissal of critical findings.
- Accelerates remediation efforts for high-impact issues.

---

## 37.2 Adapting Your Message to the Audience

### 37.2.1 Technical Audiences

- Focus on vulnerability details, reproduction steps, root causes, and recommended fixes.
- Be prepared for deep-dive questions and requests for clarifications.
- Supply evidence, logs, scripts, and system diagrams as needed.

### 37.2.2 Executive/Non-Technical Audiences

- Emphasize business impact, regulatory and reputational risks, and resource implications.
- Use analogies or risk heat maps to communicate severity.
- Stay solutions-focused - clarify how remediation aligns with business priorities.

## 37.3 Effective Presentation Techniques

- **Prioritize the Most Severe Issues:** Address critical and high-risk findings first, with emphasis on business consequences.
- **Tell the Story:** Illustrate how an attacker could chain vulnerabilities, what the outcome would be, and measures to break that chain.
- **Use Visuals:** Charts, diagrams, and tables help non-technical stakeholders quickly grasp risk exposure.
- **Encourage Questions and Discussion:** Invite interdisciplinary dialogue to uncover blind spots and clarify recommendations.

---

## 37.4 Facilitating Remediation

- Provide **clear, prioritized remediation guidance**, listing actions by severity and ease of implementation.
- Where feasible, break down actions into phases: quick wins, medium-term improvements, and strategic changes.
- Collaborate with defenders to verify feasibility - refer to playbooks or proven controls when possible.
- Offer to retest high-priority fixes as part of the engagement closure.

## 37.5 Example: Remediation Roadmap Table

| Issue                       | Severity | Recommended Action                                  | Owner    | Timeline |
| --------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Prompt Injection (API)      | Critical | Implement prompt filters, stricter input validation | DevOps   | 2 weeks  |
| Plugin Privilege Escalation | High     | Restrict plugin permissions, audit usage            | Security | 1 month  |
| Excessive Model Verbosity   | Medium   | Refine LLM output constraints                       | ML Team  | 6 weeks  |

## 37.6 Handling Difficult Conversations

- Be factual, not alarmist; avoid blame language and focus on solutions.
- Acknowledge constraints or business realities (resource limits, legacy systems).
- Help stakeholders weigh tradeoffs - sometimes, “best” security isn't immediately practical, so explain risk reduction steps.

---

## 37.7 Follow-Up and Continuous Improvement

- Schedule follow-up sessions to review remediation progress.
- Encourage tracking of open issues and regular retesting.
- Provide recommendations for improving red team processes, monitoring, and security culture.

---

## 37.8 Checklist: Presenting and Remediation

- [ ] Most severe/business-critical issues highlighted and explained.
- [ ] Technical and executive perspectives both addressed.
- [ ] Remediation actions are clear, prioritized, and actionable.
- [ ] Stakeholders have a forum to ask questions and provide feedback.
- [ ] Next steps and follow-up are agreed upon and scheduled.
