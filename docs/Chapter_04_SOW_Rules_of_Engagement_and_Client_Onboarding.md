# Chapter 4: SOW, Rules of Engagement, and Client Onboarding

## 4.1 The Foundation of a Secure Engagement

Before any AI red teaming begins, you must have clearly agreed-upon definitions of what, how, and when you are allowed to test. This is formalized through three key processes:

1. **Statement of Work (SOW):** The “contract” stating objectives, deliverables, and scope.
2. **Rules of Engagement (RoE):** The “do’s and don’ts” of your testing activities.
3. **Client Onboarding:** The people, processes, logistics, and communications needed for a successful partnership.

Failure to establish these can result in confusion, legal trouble, missed risks, or outright harm.

## 4.2 Statement of Work (SOW)

The SOW is your master document. It defines every aspect of the engagement, including:

- **Purpose/Objectives:** Why is the red team test being performed?
- **Scope:** Which systems, LLMs, APIs, and environments may be tested? What is out of bounds?
- **Timeline:** Start and end dates; important milestones or deliveries.
- **Deliverables:** What will you provide (reports, evidence, presentations)?
- **Success Metrics:** How will you, the client, and stakeholders know the work is complete and valuable?

### 4.2.1 SOW Example Table

| Section      | Example Entry                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective    | “Assess the resilience of the customer support LLM against prompt injection, data leakage, and plugin abuse in staging.”                     |
| Scope        | “Staging and dev environments only; production excluded. Testing allowed against `/api/llm`, `/plugins/x`, and `/admin-console` in staging.” |
| Timeline     | “June 1–14, 2025. Interim risk briefing after 1 week; final report due 3 days after test completion.”                                        |
| Deliverables | “Technical report, executive slide deck, reproducible evidence, scripts/tooling as needed.”                                                  |

### 4.2.2 Key SOW Pitfalls

- Vague scope boundaries (“all systems” or “everything connected to X”).
- No success metrics.
- Missing sign-off from key business/legal stakeholders.

## 4.3 Rules of Engagement (RoE)

The RoE defines _how_ testing will be conducted—including constraints, escalation paths, and safety controls. Think of this as your engagement safety net.

### 4.3.1 Typical RoE Elements

- **Time Restrictions:** “Attacks may only occur between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. EST.”
- **Methods Approved:** E.g., “Prompt fuzzing and code review allowed; no DDoS against production.”
- **Data Handling:** “Never attempt to access live customer data or production PII unless explicitly authorized and under supervision.”
- **Escalation Paths:** “Critical vulnerabilities must be reported within 1 hour to [POC] and testing paused until advised.”
- **Evidence:** “All logs and records will be stored securely and transferred to client upon request.”

### 4.3.2 Example: RoE Excerpts

> “LLM plugin testing must be isolated to staging plugins only.
>
> If a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is found, do not exploit further; collect evidence and notify the client’s security lead immediately.
>
> Social engineering of staff is out of scope for this engagement.”

### 4.3.3 When Things Go Wrong

- If you identify risk of real-world damage or legal issues: **pause and escalate.**
- Out-of-scope findings should be documented but not actively exploited.

## 4.4 Client Onboarding

A smooth onboarding process earns trust, reduces errors, and ensures you hit the ground running.

### 4.4.1 Key Onboarding Steps

- **Kickoff Meeting:** Walk through SOW, RoE, introduce team members, clarify escalation/communication.
- **Access Provisioning:** Ensure you have required test accounts, VPN, pre-configured environments, and that access is logged and easily revocable.
- **Communications Channel:** Decide how you’ll communicate day-to-day and in emergencies (email, chat, phone, ticket).
- **Shared Resources:** Confirm access to documentation, architecture diagrams, plugin/API specs, and support contacts.
- **Clarify Points of Contact (POC):** At least two on both sides, with alternates for emergencies.

### 4.4.2 Sample Onboarding Checklist

- [ ] SOW document signed by all required parties.
- [ ] RoE reviewed and acknowledged.
- [ ] Test and reporting accounts issued.
- [ ] Secure file transfer setup (for evidence/report handoff).
- [ ] Primary and backup POCs’ contact details shared.
- [ ] All working docs stored in a mutually accessible and secure location.

## 4.5 Managing Expectations and Building Trust

Set expectations early about:

- The noise, risks, and business/process impacts of your testing.
- How issues and questions will be escalated.
- What will, and will not, be included in the final reports.

Regular touchpoints (status emails, debrief meetings) keep everyone aligned and reduce surprises.

## 4.6 Review: Planning Questions for Junior Red Teamers

Before you start:

- Does your SOW clearly define scope and objectives?
- Are all stakeholders, including legal/compliance, signed off?
- Is your RoE documented, understandable, and complete?
- Do you have a clear communication path and emergency escalation route?
- Are you provisioned with all required access—_and nothing more_?
